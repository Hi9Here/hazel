          Weddings and celebrations – don’t you just love them?
        </h2>

        <p>If you’re looking for support to get your wedding business on the right track, want to talk through your sales or marketing strategy or are planning your next corporate event, you’re in the right place.</p>

        <h2>
          Hazel Parsons - here to help you
        </h2>

        <h3>I’m Hazel Parsons, self-confessed fan of all things wedding and celebration.</h3>

    <p>I offer practical, straightforward business advice and hands-on help for wedding suppliers and venues, as well as putting together unforgettable events for corporate and wedding industry clients.</p>

    <p>Starting my career some 17 years ago in hospitality, I soon developed an interest in event management with a predilection for weddings. I grew that aspect of the business for the various hotels in Cornwall I worked in and then went on to complete a degree-level marketing course.</p>

    <p>My wedding business and event consultancy sees me combine my love of organising and creative flair with the commercial acumen and relationship-building essential for creating resilient and successful businesses.</p>

    <p>My mission is simple – to help anyone connected with the wedding sector to get the most out of their business and grow sales – driving up standards across the industry.</p>

    <p>As well as working with businesses and venues on an individual basis, I believe in giving something back to the industry as a whole. 2013 saw me devise the B2B Wed MeetUps which are now firmly established as a regular (and market-leading) fixture in the South West wedding industry’s networking calendar.</p>

    <p>A member of the National Association of Wedding Planners’ (NAWP) executive team, I also blog for Ultimate Wedding magazine and host Twitter’s popular wedding community #WedChat (every Wednesday 8.30pm – 9.30pm) for brides, grooms and anyone involved in weddings.</p>

    <p>Here’s what some of my lovely clients say about me:</p>

    <h3>“A Cornish gem”</h3>

    <h3>“Totally professional with a great knowledge of the wedding industry”</h3>

    <h3>“Expert guidance, care and attention to detail”</h3>

    <h3>“Here’s to a wonderful future of working together and friendship”</h3>
